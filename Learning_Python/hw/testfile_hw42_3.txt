A Wrinkle in Time

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT.

In her attic bedroom Margaret
Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork
quilt, sat on the foot of her bed
and watched the trees tossing in
the frenzied lashing of the wind.
Behind the trees clouds scudded
frantically across the sky. Every
few moments the moon ripped through
them, creating wraithlike shadows
that raced along the ground.

The house shook.

Wrapped in her quilt, Meg shook.

She wasn't usually afraid of weather.
-It's not just the weather, she
thought. -It's the weather on top
of everything else. On top of me.
On top of Meg Murry doing everything wrong.
