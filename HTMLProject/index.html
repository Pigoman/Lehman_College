				<h2 class="center">The Story...</h2>
				<p class="space">
					This is my first car. It is a 1999 Ford Escort ZX2 that I found on Craigslist about two years ago. 
					I bought it for $900 and that was probably still too much money. 
					It had about 186,000 miles on it then and now it's up to about 210,000 miles. 
					I know, it's pretty shocking that it hasn't been scrapped in the first place, but it gets me to school and work every day.
					The main reason I chose this car, besides the fact that it was cheap, was it has a manual transmission.
					I had learned on my friend's car a few months before and was hooked.
					I also needed a car of my own to get to work at the time.
					We looked around and after one car breaking on the test drive and other options running out, we went to see this little red Ford.
					It drove much better than I expected it to on the test drive and the paperwork was there, so I paid for it and took it home.
					My parents were surprised to say the least, since they had no idea that I was even looking for a car, 
					so when I drove up with it their reaction was pretty strong. 
					We got the insurance covered that day, a friday, and I had to wait until the following Monday to go th the DMV and get license plates.
					Ever since then this little dude has been hauling me all over the tri-state area and taking it with a smile.
